# SVG Logo Maker

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

The goal of this project was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. This is useful if the user requires a simple logo for a project on their own.

## Usage

After installing the dependencies for Jest and Inquirer v8.2.4 the user will be able to input the node server command. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.
